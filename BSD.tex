\title{The BSD formula over number fields}
\author{John E. Cremona}

\begin{abstract}
  We give an explicit statement of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD)
  formula for elliptic curves over general number fields, carefully
  defining all the terms and showing how they may be be computed using
  the software packages \Sage and \Magma.  In particular, we highlight
  certain differences in the way the formula has been stated in the
  literature.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

The Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) formula for elliptic curves over
\(\Q\) is clearly stated and explained in many texts, but for elliptic
curves over general number fields there are a number of subtleties
leading to the appearance of factors which are equal to \(1\) in the
rational case, and clear and explicit statements are harder to
find. We cite three, by Tate \cite{Tate}, Gross \cite{Gross}, and
T. Dokchitser \cite{Dok}, as well as a discussion on MathOverflow
\cite{MO} highlighting the common confusions which people have. The
point of this text is to clear up the potentially confusing issues.

For simplicity we concentrate on the case of elliptic curves, only
briefly mentioning the adjustments needed for Abelian varieties of
higher dimension \(g\).

Traditionally, the BSD formula is written as a formula for the leading
coefficient of the L-series \(L(E,s)\) at \(s=1\), which we call the
\emph{L-value}, in terms of other quantities, including the order of
the \emph{Tate-Shafarevich group}~$\Sha$. We will assume the standard
conjectures, first that \(L(E,s)\) has analytic continuation so that
its behaviour at \(s=1\) is defined, and also that $\Sha$ is finite. Then
we rearrange the formula so that it expresses \(S=|\Sha|\) in terms of
quantities which may be computed.

\section{Code}\label{code}

Where possible, we give the appropriate commands in \Sage (version
10.1) and \Magma (version V2.28-3) to compute these quantities. Many
of these functions have a precision parameter to control the precision
of the output: the input is always exact, but the output may in
principle be computed to arbitrary precision. \Magma can compute all
the quantities separately (with a little work) and can also evaluate
the entire formula. \Sage can compute all the quantities; unless
\(K=\Q\), computing the analytic rank and L-value itself currently
requires calling \Magma from \Sage, or using \GP library functions.

\subsection{\Magma}\label{magma}

For elliptic curves over general number fields all terms in the formula
are computed and combined in the function \texttt{ConjecturalSha()}:

\[
\texttt{ConjecturalSha(E,\ {[}P1,...,Pr{]});}
\]

\subsection{\Sage}\label{sage}

For elliptic curves over \(\Q\) only, we have:

\[
\texttt{E.sha().an\_numerical()}
\]

\section{Notation}\label{notation}

\(K\) is a number field of degree \(d=r_1+2r_2\), where \(r_1\) and
\(r_2\) are the number of real and complex places, and discriminant
\(d_K\).

\(E\) is an elliptic curve defined over \(K\), given by an integral
Weierstrass equation or model with coefficients \(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6\).
We do not assume that the model we have is minimal; global minimal
models do not always exist anyway. We denote by \(\Delta(E)\) the
discriminant of the model, which is an integral element of \(K\), and by
\(\mathfrak{d}(E)\) the minimal discriminant ideal of \(E\), an integral
ideal which is independent of the model. Then
\((\Delta(E))/\mathfrak{d}(E) = \mathfrak{u}_E^{12}\) for some fractional
ideal \(\mathfrak{u}_E\). (A global minimal model exists if and only if
\(\mathfrak{u}\) is principal; in general the class of \(\mathfrak{u}_E\)
is an invariant of \(E\).)

The Mordell-Weil group \(E(K)\) is a finitely-generated abelian group of
rank \(r=r(E(K))\), with finite torsion subgroup \(T=E(K)_{\tors}\). Let
\(P_1,\dots,P_r\in E(K)\) be points which generate \(E(K)/T\).

\section{Outline formula}\label{outline-formula}

The formula for \(S\) has the form
\[
S = \frac{(\text{field-factor})(\text{$L$-value})}{(\text{Mordell-Weil factor})(\text{local-factor})}.
\]
We will define each of these factors in turn.  Note that while
different sources disagree on the exact definitions of the factors,
the differences cancel out in the product: in particular there is a
factor $2^{r_2}$ which is included either by multiplying the
local-factor (as in \cite{Dok}) and or by dividing the field-factor
(as in \cite{Tate}).

\section{The field factor}\label{field-factor}

This is \[|d_K|^{1/2},\] so is equal to \(1\) for \(K=\Q\).

Gross includes this in with the local factors at infinite places.  In
some expositions, there is an extra factor of $2$ in the contribution
from each complex place to the local factor, and the field factor is
set to \(|d_K|^{1/2}/2^{r_2}\) to compensate.

For Abelian varieties of dimension \(g\) the factor is
\(|d_K|^{g/2}\).

\subsection{\Magma code:}\label{magma-1}

\[
\texttt{Sqrt(Abs(Discriminant(K)));}
\]

\subsection{\Sage code:}\label{sage-1}

\[
\texttt{RR(K.discriminant().abs()).sqrt()}
\]

\section{The L-value}\label{the-l-value}

This is \[L^{(r)}(E,1)/r!.\] Note that in general it is only conjectural
that the L-function of \(E\) has analytic continuation as far as
\(s=1\), so both the fact that this quantity is well-defined, and the
analytic properties assumed in the algorithm to evaluate its derivative
at \(s=1\), are conjectural.

\subsection{\Magma code:}\label{magma-2}

\[
\texttt{Evaluate(LSeries(E),1:\ Derivative:=r)\ /\ Factorial(r);}
\]

\subsection{\Sage code:}\label{sage-2}

For \(K=\Q\) only:

\texttt{E.lseries().dokchitser().derivative(1,r)\ /\ factorial(r)}

Otherwise on a system with \Magma installed one can resort to

\[
\texttt{RR(magma(E).LSeries().Evaluate(1,\ Derivative=r))\ /\ factorial(r)}
\]

\section{The Mordell-Weil factor}\label{mordell-weil-factor}

This is \[\frac{R(P_1,\dots,P_r)}{|T|^2},\] where \(R()\) is the
regulator, i.e.~the determinant of the height pairing matrix. This needs
to be normalised correctly.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \((i,j)\)-entry of the height pairing matrix is
  \[\left\langle P_i,P_j\right\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(\hh(P_i+P_j) - \hh(P_i) - \hh(P_j)),\]
  so in particular the diagonal entries are the canonical heights of the
\(P_i\);
\item The canonical height should be defined with respect to the
  \(x\)-coordinate (so that \(x(P)-\hh(P)\) is bounded independently
  of \(P\)). There is another convention (used in some of Silverman's
  papers, for example \cite{Silverman}) which is half of this, as it
  is defined with respect to the divisor \((O)\) instead of
  \(2(O)\). In the MathOverflow post \cite{MO}, Silverman explains why
  it makes sense to use \(2(O)\) in the context of BSD.
\item The canonical height should \textbf{not} be normalized (by
  dividing by the degree \(d\)) to be invariant under
  base-change. Note that both \Magma and \Sage by default normalize
  the height. \Sage has an option to not normalize for heights, but
  not (as of version 9.1) for the regulator. Hence in both cases the
  regulator needs to be adjusted by multiplying by \(d^r\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\Magma code:}\label{magma-3}

\[
\texttt{Regulator(P1,...,Pr)\ *\ d\^{}r\ /\ Order(TorsionSubgroup(E))\^{}2;}
\]

\subsection{\Sage code:}\label{sage-3}

\[
\texttt{E.regulator\_of\_points({[}P1,...,Pr{]}, normalised=False)\ /\ E.torsion\_order()\^{}2}
\]

The expression given here will only be correct if the points
\(P_1,\dots,P_r\) are \emph{saturated}, i.e.~generate all of \(E(K)\)
modulo torsion, so that
\([E(K):\left\langle P_1,\dots,P_r\right\rangle] = |T|\). An alternative
expression is sometimes seen which avoids this condition:
\[\frac{R(P_1,\dots,P_r)}{[E(K):\left\langle P_1,\dots,P_r\right\rangle]^2};\]
this is a neat trick, but not very useful in practice for computations.

\textbf{NB} If we evaluate the formula with points are not saturated
but only generate a subgroup (modulo torsion) of index \(n\), then
this factor, and hence the overall expression for \(S\), will be
\(1/n^2\) times the correct value. This will often lead to a
non-integral value of \(S\), which can be detected.

\subsection{Higher genus}\label{higher-genus}

For Abelian varieties \(A\) of general dimension \(g\) the formula
involves both \(A\) and its dual \(A'\), and points \(P_1',\dots,P_r'\)
generating \(A'(K)\) modulo torsion. (Recall that \(A\) and \(A'\) are
isogenous so have the same rank \(r\).) The factor is then
\[\frac{\det(\left\langle P_i,P'_j\right\rangle )}{\#A(K)_{\tors}\cdot \#A'(K)_{\tors}}\]
where now \(\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>\) is the height pairing between
\(A\) and \(A'\).

\section{The local factor}\label{local-factors}

The complete local factor is a product of individual local factors,
one for each place of \(K\). We will define the local factors at
infinite places will be defined in a way which depends on the model,
but the complete local factor also includes a correction factor making
the complete expression independent of the model.

\subsection{At finite places}\label{at-finite-places}

At a finite place \(v\) the local factor is \(c_v\), the Tamagawa number
at \(v\). This is a positive integer, the index
\(c_v = [E(K_v):E(K_v)^0]\), i.e.~the number of connected components of
\(E(K_v)\). At a place of good reduction we have \(c_v=1\), so this is
in effect a finite product.

\subsection{\Magma code:}\label{magma-4}

\[
\texttt{\&*TamagawaNumbers(E);}
\]
gives the product of the Tamagawa numbers \(c_v\).

\subsection{\Sage code:}\label{sage-4}

Over all number fields (including \(\Q\))
\[
\texttt{E.tamagawa\_product\_bsd()}
\]
gives the product of all Tamagawa numbers \(c_v\) times the correction
factor \(N(\mathfrak{u})_E\) (defined below) to allow for the model not
being minimal, while \texttt{E.tamagawa\_product()} returns
just the product of the Tamagawa numbers (over \(\Q\) only).

\subsection{At infinite places}\label{at-infinite-places}

At each infinite place the local factor is a suitably normalized period
\(\Omega_v\) and the total contribution from all infinite places is
\(\prod_{v\mid\infty}\Omega_v\). Theoretically the \(\Omega_v\) are
defined in terms of a N\'eron differential. We first define the periods
for a fixed model of \(E\) and then explain how to normalize them. Let
\(\omega_E = dx/(2y+a_1x+a_3)\) be the usual invariant differential
associated to a Weierstrass model for \(E\).

\subsection{At a real place}\label{at-a-real-place}

If \(v\) is a real place define \(\Omega_v(E)\) to be the integral of
\(\omega_E\) over \(E(\R)\). This is equal to the least positive real
period multiplied by the number of real components at the place \(v\)
(which is \(1\) when \(v(\Delta_E)<0\) and \(2\) when
\(v(\Delta_E)>0\)).

When \(v(\Delta_E)>0\) the period lattice of \(E\) at \(v\) has
generating periods \(x\), \(yi\) with \(x,y>0\), and \(\Omega_v=2x\).
When \(v(\Delta_E)<0\) the period lattice of \(E\) at \(v\) has
generating periods \(2x\), \(x+yi\) with \(x,y>0\), and \(\Omega_v=2x\).

\subsection{At a complex place}\label{at-a-complex-place}

If \(v\) is a complex place define \(\Omega_v(E)\) to be the integral
of \(\omega_E\wedge\overline{\omega_E}\) over \(E(\C)\). If the period
lattice of \(E\) at \(v\) has generating periods \(w_1\), \(w_2\) with
\(\Im(w_2/w_1)>0\), then \(\Omega_v=2\Im(\overline{w_1}w_2)\), which
is positive: it is double the covolume of the period lattice.

In \cite{Dok}, \(\Omega_v\) for complex \(v\) is defined to be double
the definition here, which appears to be an error.  Note that if we
instead defined $\Omega_v$ to be the lattice covolume, we would need
to compensate by dividing the field factor by~$2^{r_2}$.

\subsection{Adjustment for non-minimal models}\label{adjustment-for-non-minimal-models}

For a global minimal model, the minimal discriminant ideal is simply the
principal ideal \(\mathfrak{d}(E)=(\Delta(E))\). In general,
\((\Delta(E))=\mathfrak{u}_E^{12}\mathfrak{d}(E)\) for some fractional
ideal \(\mathfrak{u}_E\) whose valuation at each prime \(\mathfrak{p}\) is
\(1/12\) of the difference between the valuation at \(\mathfrak{p}\) of
\(\Delta(E)\) and that of the local minimal model at \(\mathfrak{p}\).

The product \(\prod_{v\mid\infty}\Omega_v N(\mathfrak{u}_E)\) is
independent of the model.  Scaling the model for~$E$ by~$\lambda\in
K^*$ multiplies~$\mathfrak{u}_E$ by the principal ideal~$(\lambda)$
and hence multiples~\(N(\mathfrak{u}_E)\) by \(|N(\lambda)|\); in
compensation, \(\Omega_v\) (for each infinite place~$v$) is
multiplied by~$|\lambda|_v$, and the product of these is
again~\(|N(\lambda)|\).

\subsection{Complete local factor}\label{complete-local-factor}
The complete local factor, including a contribution from all finite
and infinite places and independent of the model,  is
\[
\prod_{v\nmid\infty}c_v\prod_{v\mid\infty}\Omega_v N(\mathfrak{u}_E)
=
\prod_{v\nmid\infty}c_v\prod_{v\mid\infty}\Omega_v \left|\frac{N(\Delta(E))}{N(\mathfrak{d}(E)}\right|^{1/12}.
\]

\subsection{\Magma code:}\label{magma-5}
\[
\texttt{Periods(E);}
\]
gives a basis for the period lattice with respect to each infinite
place, starting with the real places. In evaluating
\texttt{ConjecturalSha()} the product of the actual real and complex
periods \(\Omega_v\) are computed from these, including factors of 2
for the real places where the discriminant is positive and a factor
\(2^{r_2}\) from the Dokchitser normalisation of the complex periods,
but the individual \(\Omega_v\) values are not easily accessible to
the user.

\subsection{\Sage code:}\label{sage-5}
For each infinite place,
\[
\texttt{E.period\_lattice(v).omega()}
\]
gives the value of \(\Omega_v\), including the factor of 2 for real
places where the discriminant is positive.  Hence the complete local
factor is given by
\[
\texttt{prod({[}EK.period\_lattice(v).omega()\ for\ v\ in\ K.places(){]})\ *\ E.tamagawa\_product\_bsd()}
\]

\section{The full formula}\label{the-full-formula}
The analytic order of $\Sha$ is given by the formula
\[
S =
|d_K|^{1/2}
\cdot
\frac{L^{(r)}(E,1)}{r!}
\cdot
\frac{|T|^2}{R(P_1,\dots,P_r)}
\cdot
\frac{1}{N(\mathfrak{u}_E)\prod_{v\nmid\infty}c_v\prod_{v\mid\infty}\Omega_v}.
\]

\section{Comparisons}\label{comparisons}

\subsection{Tate}\label{tate}

In \cite{Tate}, Tate has a factor \(|\mu|^g\) where \(g\) (which is
\(d\) in Tate's notation) is the dimension of the variety and he
states that \(|\mu|=|d_K|^{1/2}/2^{r_2}\).

While this differs from our field factor, the difference can be
accounted for by doubling the contribution at the complex places, the
normalization for which Tate does not make explicit.

\subsection{Gross}\label{gross}

In \cite{Gross}, Gross states the formula for an abelian variety $A$
in the form L-value\(=M(A)R(A)h(A)\) where \(h(A)=|\Sha|\). In the
analogy with the analytic class number formula, $\Sha$ plays the role
of the class group whose order is usually denoted \(h\). The other two
factors match our Mordell-Weil factor, and the product of the field
and local factors respectively: for $A=E$ an elliptic curve,
\begin{itemize}
  \item
\(R(E)=R(P_1,\dots,R_r)/|T|^2\) for elliptic curves \(E\), adjusted as
before for general dimension.
\item
\(M(E) = M_{\infty}(E)M_f(E)\), where (in our notation)
\[M_{\infty}(E) = \prod_{v\mid\infty}\Omega_v \cdot N(\mathfrak{u}_E) \cdot |d_K|^{-1/2},\]
and \(M_f(E)\) is the Tamagawa product \(\prod_{v\nmid\infty}c_v\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dokchitser}\label{dokchitser}

In \cite[pp.~3--5]{Dok}, Dokchitser defines the regulator and L-value
as we have. He states that the regulator is the determinant of the
\textbf{N\'eron-Tate height-pairing}, where the prefix
``N\'eron-Tate'' indicates that the height is relative to \(K\) and
not the normalized absolute one.

He combines all the local factors together into a quantity called
\(C_{E/K}\): Writing \(\omega\) for any invariant differential on \(E\)
(with arbitrary scaling), and \(\omega_v^o\) the local N\'eron
differential at a finite place \(v\), he defines \[
  C_{E/K} = \prod_{v\nmid\infty} c_v \left\vert\frac{\omega}{\omega_v^o}\right\vert_{_v}
    \>\cdot\>\prod_{{v|\infty},{\real}} \int\limits_{E(K_v)}\!\! |\omega|
    \>\cdot\>\prod_{{v|\infty},{\complex}} 2\!\!\!\int\limits_{E(K_v)}\!\! \omega_E\wedge \bar\omega_E,
\] with \(c_v\) the local Tamagawa number at \(v\) and \(|\cdot|_v\) the
normalised absolute value on \(K_v\). If \(\omega\) is the differential
associated to a global minimal model then
\(\left\vert\frac{\omega}{\omega_v^o}\right\vert_{_v}=1\) for all finite
\(v\) and this reduces to our unadjusted local factor. In general the
factor \(N(\mathfrak{u}_E)\) in our formula accounts for the difference in
scaling between the differential \(\omega_E\) and the local N\'eron
differential \(\omega_v^o\) at every place.

We see that \(C_{E/K}\) is independent of the model of \(E\), and is
$2^{r_2}$ times our local factor.  Otherwise, his formula is identical
to ours.
