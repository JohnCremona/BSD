We cite three (by Tate, Gross, and T. Dokchitser) below, as well as a discussion on MathOverflow highlighting the common confusions which people have.  The point of this text is to clear up the potentially confusing issues.\n",

We always assume the standard conjectures, first that $L(E,s)$ has analytic continuation so that its behaviour at $s=1$ is defined, and also that &#1064; is finite.  Then we rearrange the formula so that it expresses $S=$|&#1064;| in terms of quantities which may be computed. "
